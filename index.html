<li><h2>Atmospheric Variations as observed by IceCube <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.0776v2.pdf">PDF</a></h2>
<h3><small>Serap Tilav, Paolo Desiati, Takao Kuwabara, Dominick Rocco, Florian Rothmaier, Matt Simmons, Henrike Wissing for the IceCube Collaboration</small></h3>
<p>The correlation between the IceCube data and short and long term climate events was analyzed. Seasonal changes in cosmic ray interactions were observed, which is explained by the changing density of the stratosphere as it gets warmer and colder. The South Pole has weather patterns that isolate it until the summer, which leads to a very abrupt temperature change which allows for this effect to be studied in more detail. Observed atmospheric muons >400Gev primarily from 2007 to 2009.</p>

<li><h2>The Gran Sasso Muon Puzzle <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.5180v3.pdf">PDF</a></h2>
<h3><small>Enrique Fernandez-Martinez and Rakhi Mahbubani</small></h3>
<p>Took data from three experiments, MACRO, LVO, and Borexino, over 20 years and compared it with the data from the DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA dark matter experiments over the same time period. The particles detected correlated to a sea-level muon energy of ~1.3TeV. A 10-11 year cycle, which correlated with the solar cycle, was observed, as well as annual cycle.</p>

<li><h2>Atmospheric Muons: Experimental Aspects <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.1171v1.pdf">PDF</a></h2>
<h3><small>S. Cecchini and M. Spurio</small></h3>
<p>Describes how particles of different energy levels are affected by the atmosphere and lithosphere, and that muons are most commonly detected for due to their relatively long lifetimes and decent penetration, losing ~2GeV through the atmosphere. 100GeV is the threshold where more muons tend to interact instead of decaying. Angular distribution of muons depends on their energy, and at lower zenith angles they have higher energies.</p>

<li><h2>Understanding the Effect of Atmospheric Density on the Cosmic Ray Flux Variations at the Earth Surface <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.7191v1.pdf">PDF</a></h2>
<h3><small>Mathes Dayananda, Xiaohang Zhang, Carola Butler and Xiaochun He</small></h3>
<p>A relationship between galactic cosmic ray flux and low cloud coverage was observed, which is explained by the cosmic rays ionizing the atmosphere, influencing cloud formation. There are also a number of different atmospheric conditions that affect cosmic ray flux.</p>

<li><h2>Seasonal Variations of the Muon Multiplicity in Cosmic Rays at South Pole <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.7006.pdf">PDF</a></h2>
<h3><small>The IceCube Collaboration</small></h3>
<p>Because of the Earth's axial tilt, the South Pole sees extreme seasonal variations, which are caused by atmospheric heating and cooling. T<sub>eff</sub> is used to define the effect that temperature has on muon flux. In simulation, particles of up to 300PeV were used to observe what effects atmospheric temperature has on the decay of higher energy primary particles.</p>

<li><h2>Observation of muon intensity variations by season with the MINOS Near Detector <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prd/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevD.90.012010">PDF</a></h2>
<h3><small>P. Adamson et. al.</small></h3>
<p>Seasonal variations in underground detectors is a well-established phenomenon that is attributed to atmospheric temperature/pressure changes influences the number of particle interactions. In addition to the seasonal changes, a small but steady decrease in muon rates has been observed. Detector effects have been ruled out due to the effect being stronger in longer tracks than it is in shorter ones. Continues to analyze the effects that zenith angle, and temperature have on muon rates in the MINOS near detector.</p>

<h3><small>R.R.S. De Mendonça, J.-P. Raulin, F.C.P. Bertoni, E. Echer, V.S. Makhmutov, G. Fernandez</small></h3>
<p>Looks into the associations between geomagnetic activity and detected cosmic ray flux. Geomagnetic storms caused by passages of intense southward directed interplanetary magnetic fields can affect cosmic ray flux, though the relationship between them is complex. Also looks into the effects that weather can have on cosmic ray flux. Has 4 years of records.</p>

<li><h2>DAMA vs. the Annually Modulated Muon Background <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.0857v1.pdf">PDF</a></h2>
<h3><small>Kfir Blum</small></h3>
<p>Over 13 annual cycles, dark matter events in the DAMA detector have deviated from the pure sinosuidal form that would be expected. A strong correlation between the dark matter data and muon data was found, so the muon data was used to search for a possible background process that could be causing the variations. The anomoly has existed ofr over a decade, however no background processes have been found to explain it. 2-4 KeV particles were analyzed.</p>

<p>This is an analysis of the data received from the Ulysses spacecraft, which was launched for a final heliocentric orbit with an inclination of 80.2&#176; in 1990. The paper discusses the various effects that affect the paths of cosmic rays, and how the primary effector of the data collected by the probe was the Hale Cycle. The mission collected data through 3/4ths of one Hale Cycle.</p>
